# SystemVerilog For Verification

## Introduction
This repository contains SystemVerilog code examples aimed at illustrating various verification techniques. The examples are sourced from three main references: 
  - "SystemVerilog for Verification: A Guide to Learning the Testbench Language Features" 
  - Dr. Ayman Wahba Lectures
  - Additionally, I've added my contributions and explanations to enhance the educational value of each example.

## Topics Covered
- **Data Types:**
  - Overview of built-in data types, including arrays and queues.
  - Explanation of dynamic arrays, associative arrays, and linked lists.
  - Utilizing array methods and choosing appropriate storage types.
  - Creating user-defined structures, enumerated types, and constants.
  - Understanding strings, expression width, and net types.
