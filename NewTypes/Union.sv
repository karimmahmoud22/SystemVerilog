Notes:
    You can define a union with many members, 
    but only one member can contain a value at any given time

    Its size is the size of the largest data type of its elements

    Unions are useful when you frequently need to read and write a register in 
    several different formats

    To use unions you must add the argument â€“lca (Limited Customer Availability) 
    to the command line of the compiler.
